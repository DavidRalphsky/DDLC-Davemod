EDIT: I give everyone full permission to edit or steal or whatever you want this mod. I haven't worked on it in 8 months and don't plan to work on it in future. If you want to finish this mod or take some of its ideas or some of its code (lol "code" it's ren'py & basic python) then go ahead, you don't even have to give me credit.
